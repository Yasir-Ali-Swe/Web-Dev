# Web Development Course & MERN Stack Learning Repository

This repository contains all the assignments, projects, and exercises completed during my Web Development course in sixth semester of my BSSE program, as well as additional work related to my self-study of the MERN stack.

## Course Topics

- **HTML**: Structure your web content with semantic tags and elements.
- **CSS**: Style your web pages with layouts, colors, and fonts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilize a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Add interactivity and logic to your web pages.

## MERN Stack Learning

In addition to the course topics, I am also learning the MERN stack on my own. The MERN stack includes:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building server-side applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
